  "-419b8728": "Soft skills",

  "-378ee8af": "Cross-age peer mentoring",
  "3d7e7639": "Engaging with students over a long period of time allows us to frame their learning as essentially community-based and participatory.

Residents aren’t required to produce anything while they’re here. If they just need to spend a month reading, hanging out with the horses, and drawing, great. If they want to attempt their most ambitious piece yet, also great.",

We also introduce them to our collector base, commission them for public art, work with them on education programs, and invite them to serve as visiting artists or review panelists for future residency cohorts.",

The interviews, projects, artworks, photos, and materials presented here are meant to allow for that same process of meaning-making. If you think we're missing something, ",
