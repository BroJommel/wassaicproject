  **Celebrate spring at the Wassaic Project by eating, drinking, learning, and
  making!**


  Join visiting artists Kim Hall and Justin Hardison from Nottene Studio and
  learn to make relief prints with three-dimensional objects. You’ll ink things
  of unusual shapes, make prints with them on fabric, paper, and other
  materials, and leave with a printed tea towel and paper print. Your print may
  also be added to Hall and Hardison’s large-scale mural in our 2022 Summer
  Exhibition! We’ll provide cocktails and light food, curated to the season and
  workshop by Johnny Dearth, Erika DaSilva, and Minh Le of The Lantern Inn.


  Please bring a few small objects that are okay to get ink on them. If you’d
  like, consider these prompts in advance:


  *   Where is your favorite place?

  *   Where do you feel at home?

  *   What objects contribute to your sense of belonging?

  *   What objects do you belong with?

  *   What objects make your home feel like a home?


  Please note that we will be requiring proof of vaccination at this workshop as
  well.
