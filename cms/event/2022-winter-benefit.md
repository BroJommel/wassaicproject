f_short-description: Join us at our annual Winter Benefit—this time at Tenmile Distillery
title: 2022 Winter Benefit
f_location: Tenmile Distillery
f_description: >-
  **Our Winter Benefit is back — with a new date!** Join us at Wassaic’s own
  Tenmile Distillery to celebrate the year ahead. We’ll have heavy hors
  d’oeuvres and all the locally distilled spirits you can handle. All guests
  will head home with a bottle of gin, custom Wassaic Project cocktail glasses,
  and jiggers, too!


  Originally planned for February, we’ve pushed this event back one month in
  response to the recent rise in COVID cases. We’ll be requiring vaccines and
  boosters, and have secured DOH-approved rapid testing for all attendees — we
  ask that you either test upon arrival or show proof of a negative test result
  from the preceding 48 hours. Fine print on these requirements below, and thank
  you in advance for helping keep our event safe! We can’t wait to see you
  there.


  With love,  

  Eve, Bowie, and Jeff
