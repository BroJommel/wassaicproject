f_description: "Art Scouts camps are for our younger creative explorers, rising grades 1 through 3. The first session of Art Scouts runs July 11–15 from 9 AM to 2 PM at Maxon Mills. Scouts will embark on creative projects indoors and outdoors, inspired by the Wassaic Project summer exhibition and their own \_imaginations. We'll also play games, explore the Wassaic backyard, visit artist studios, and have fun! Scouts will be led by Washington Montessori art teacher Daisy Laing with support from Wassaic Project staff.\n\nProof of vaccination will be required, and we will continue to evaluate the COVID-19 risk in our area, and to refer to CDC guidelines. Please make sure to fill out the medical and permission forms linked on our website. We ask that all campers bring their own bag lunches, wear close-toed shoes, and come prepared with whatever they need to have fun in all weathers — suncreen, bug spray, hats, raincoats, etc.!\n\nCheck out our other summer offerings for your age group! 1st–3rd graders can all sign up for our Saturday Morning Sessions and 3rd graders can also sign up for our Afternoon Summer Sessions.\n\n**Before the first day of camp:**\n\n1) Fill out the registration and payment information below. Only 12 slots are available, so register early!\n\n2) Read and sign our [photo release](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a56409e914e6badf50e083c/t/5ca2ddc853450ac9825d4215/1554177480540/WP+Photo+Release+%282019-04-01+at+23-45+by+JB%29.pdf).\n\n3) Ask your pediatrician to complete this [medical form](https://wassaicproject.squarespace.com/s/Medical_Form_WP-1.pdf)."
