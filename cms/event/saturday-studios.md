f_description: "Alongside our other summer camps, this free-form studio time allows students to pursue self-directed projects inspired by our 2022 Summer Exhibition. Instructors will provide lessons and open-ended creative prompts \_and encourage students to follow their own inspiration and intuition. We'll also talk about contemporary artists, tour the summer show, visit artist studios, explore different techniques, and make cool stuff. We want kids to have fun making art in Wassaic!\n\nCheck out our other summer offerings for your age group, too! Sign up for one, two, or as many as you would like.\n\n**Before the first day of camp:**\n\n1) Fill out the registration and payment information below.\n\n2) Read and sign our [photo release](https://www.wassaicproject.org/s/2022-Photo-Release-Form-for-Minors.pdf).\n\n3) Ask your pediatrician to complete this [medical form](https://wassaicproject.squarespace.com/s/2022-Youth-Medical-Form.pdf).
