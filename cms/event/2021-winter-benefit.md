  This year, we can’t party in the same room, so we’re inviting you to many
  rooms, through a series of **four virtual tours of collectors' homes and
  artists' studios:**Jan 21: **Raymond Learsy** with [**Nicole
  Dyer**](https://www.wassaicproject.org/artists/artist-profiles/list/nicole-dyer)Feb
  3: **Janet Offensend** with [**Tatiana
  Arocha**](https://www.wassaicproject.org/artists/artist-profiles/list/tatiana-arocha)Feb
  10: **Karen Zukowski** with [**Jessye
  McDowell**](https://www.wassaicproject.org/artists/artist-profiles/list/jessye-mcdowell)Feb
  17: **Damian and Britt Zunino** of Studio DB with [**Ghost of a
  Dream**](https://www.wassaicproject.org/artists/artist-profiles/list/ghost-of-a-dream)It’s
  a unique opportunity to tour the beautiful homes of four art collectors and
  see selected works in their personal collections by a variety of artists. Each
  tour will be a collaboration between the collector and the artist — with the
  collector exploring how the artist's work fits within their collection, and
  the artist exploring the process behind the creation of each of the works
  shown. Tickets are $300 per tour. All tours run from 6:00–7:30 PM.Each of the
  artists featured will also be producing a **limited-edition print** with
  [Kayrock Screenprinting](https://www.kayrock.org/index.php) exclusively for
  this event, available in a separate ticket bundle. All ticket-buyers will also
  receive a (newly released!) Wassaic Project **umbrella**.We hope to see you
  there! Your generosity makes everything we do possible.With love,Eve, Bowie,
  and Jeff
