title: Heirlooms
f_subtitle: Works from the Another Country Quilt Cycle
f_introduction: >-
  **_Heirlooms_** is a series of quilts and smaller process works that present
  multilayered narratives, each encoded with a pattern that invites us to unpack
  and investigate the tangled cords of systemic racism that have betrayed
  America’s proclaimed values since its inception.


  Referencing inherited objects and traditions, DARNstudio creates dialogue
  around ideas and beliefs passed down that are insidious and morally abject.
  Our national inheritance includes an altogether darker component that is at
  the root of, or exacerbates every societal ill that plagues our contemporary
  social consciousness. This inheritance is our history of slavery; its lasting,
  ongoing impact; and the racism invented and indoctrinated to justify it.


  On the surface, the work, much like the erstwhile grain elevator in which it
  is installed, invokes timeworn agrarian ideals centering human industry and a
  sentimental yearning for days past. Both the traditional quilt, a precious
  keepsake passed down through generations, and the grain elevator, once rising
  steeple-like in small towns across our rural landscape, speak to a simplified,
  homogenized notion of America depicted in art and music and reified as
  national identity. This show, removed from a traditional art context and sited
  in this mill-cum-gallery, opens itself to alternate, more nuanced, if not
  challenging, interpretations.


  [DARNstudio](https://www.darnstudio.com/artiststatement) embarked upon
  [Another Country: A Quilt Cycle](https://www.darnstudio.com/anothercountry) in
  2016. A series-in-process of thirteen quilts made of custom made souvenir
  matchbooks, the project is inspired by the Underground Railroad quilts whose
  secret codes were allegedly used as signposts to help the enslaved seeking
  freedom and safe(r) haven in the North. Each quilt in the cycle is composed of
  approximately 2,800 matchbooks whose covers bear logos memorializing the place
  where an unarmed black victim of police violence, stand-your-ground policy,
  and/or racial terrorism was killed. The backs of the matchbooks contain
  alphanumeric codes comprised of the first and last initial of the victim and
  date of their deaths. Like their abolitionist antecedents, these quilts serve
  as talisman-like artifacts, with their stitched together matchbooks acting as
  a kind of map, inviting us to decipher their patterns and meanings.


  **_Heirlooms_** brings together six of the "Another Country" quilts into
  reclaimed space, made sacred by holding room for reflection and remembrance
  while asking us to contemplate: “what heirlooms will _we_ leave for future
  generations?”
