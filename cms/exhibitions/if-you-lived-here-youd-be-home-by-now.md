f_introduction: >-
  **Welcome home.** This year, we’ve given more space to a smaller group of
  artists, so that each corner of each floor of Maxon Mills can become its own
  world. There’s no big group theme here (we’d rather hear what the art meant to
  you than tell you what it should mean), but there is a rhythm. So relax if you
  can. Let the art come to you, surprise you, make you laugh. That’s what we
  really want to offer as we emerge back into the world: space to listen, space
  to think. Taken all together, maybe it’ll start to feel like a place you could
  live. Maybe it’ll start to feel like home.

  Jen Catron and Paul Outlaw stand in the middle of a circular diner counter
  stacked with paper mache burgers. More burgers hang against the black
  background; a large disco-ball-y ear hangs above.
