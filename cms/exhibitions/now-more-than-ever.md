  Now, more than ever what?


  Maybe just that: things feel urgent. Now, more than ever, a new world feels
  inevitable, and a better one feels, maybe, possible. At the particular now in
  which we’re writing this (10:56 PM, Sunday, June 7, 2020), it has been exactly
  100 days since New York City’s first confirmed coronavirus case, 13 days since
  the murder of George Floyd, and 5 hours since the Minneapolis City Council
  announced a veto-proof majority vote to begin defunding their city’s police
  department.


  Three things there.


  The first: an experience simultaneously collective and so very, very not
  collective — novel, yes, but revealing nothing new. What was for some reason
  seen as a great equalizer has mostly highlighted — and entrenched —
  preexisting social and economic inequities. That a grossly disproportionate
  number of the more than 100,000 Americans who have died of COVID-19 come from
  economically disadvantaged communities is no coincidence. That, in some
  cities, Black residents died from the virus at twice the rate of white
  residents is no coincidence, either.


  The second: an event neither novel nor revealing of anything new. The murder
  of George Floyd — along with the murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor,
  Tony McDade, and hundreds more Black men and women across the country — is
  only the latest consequence of the 400 years of cruel, casual disregard for
  Black life upon which this country is built. That the protests sparked by
  these murders have been met with concentrated acts of violence on the part of
  the police is, likewise, distressingly predictable.


  But the third! The third signals the coming of something, maybe, new under the
  sun. That those protests have placed serious attention on efforts to defund
  the police and introduce new, community-based models of public safety is
  remarkable in and of itself. That Minneapolis is poised to do it _right now_
  makes us feel, against all odds, hopeful. Whether that hope proves warranted
  will depend, at root, on the degree to which we can, with care, imagine
  newness. Which is to say: it _is_ possible that in the coming years we begin
  to build a country that values service and justice over order and control, but
  it is very, very possible that we do not. It will take real people — you,
  reading, included — making efforts both physical and mental, over a long
  period of time, to change fundamentally the ways they go about seeing and
  living in the world. It will take, more than anything, an unprecedented act of
  collective, radical imagination.


  Which brings us to art (this is, yes, an art exhibition, and we are, yes, an
  art organization). Because if all art is political (and it is), then there is
  no useful distinction whatsoever between artistic imagination and political
  imagination. Whatever imaginative force guides the hand of a painter is
  exactly the same force by which activists and organizers will envision our new
  world. Or, at least, it _can_ be. It’s the same problem as before, on a
  smaller scale: it’s possible — and, we believe, essential — that contemporary
  artists become integral to the collective social imagination of our country in
  the coming years, but it’s very, very possible that they do not. It is helpful
  to remember that, to you viewing this show, the importance of contemporary art
  is likely self-evident, but that it is by no means self-evident to Americans
  at large — nor should it be. We are convinced that contemporary art can foster
  positive social change, but we are also clear-eyed about the fact that — given
  a commodity-driven art world that disproportionately elevates the work of cis
  white men — it very often doesn’t. This, too, will require an act of sustained
  imagination to remedy. For us at the Wassaic Project, we will, as just a
  start, be increasing the number of no-fee residencies we offer each year to
  artists of color from eight to ten, making a curatorial commitment to show the
  work of more artists of color, allocating more of our commissioning funds
  towards supporting that work, and working to make our board and staff more
  representative of the artists we show and support. But for those commitments
  (and the commitments to come) to mean anything will require your imagination,
  too — a willingness to let in, be affected, and be changed by the work you
  encounter.


  So: this show. It features 161 works by 67 artists, laid out in a way that
  mimics the physical spaces in and around Maxon Mills — the historic,
  seven-floor grain mill out of which we host all our exhibitions. Almost all of
  the work in the show was selected well before the onset of COVID-19 prevented
  us from hosting a physical show, but, rather than push that work into next
  year’s show, we’ve taken the opportunity to explore a new medium for
  exhibition. What we lose by not being able to physically install the work, we
  hope to gain back in challenging you, the viewer, to engage in the same acts
  of seeing as the artists did and, in so doing, push yourself out of the
  frameworks through which you may usually see the world.


  To take a few examples: on the first floor (so to speak) Shiva Aliabadi asks
  you to step right into one such way of seeing, onto the copper foils of her
  _Yield II_ installation. Invoking her own experiences stepping into Iranian
  mosques, it’s engulfing to the point of mirage — _there_, but visibly fraying;
  the awe, yes, but the agitation, too, over moments that are always already
  fading. Conversely, on the third floor, Sholeh Asgary’s _In Blue Time_ is more
  an exercise in witnessing than seeing. The overlapping drips of her water
  clocks are deliberately impenetrable — they’re “about” Asgary’s memories
  growing up as a refugee only insofar as they generate, in us, the same quiet
  wonder of not knowing that those experiences did in her. And on the fifth
  floor, Aisha Tandiwe Bell’s traps and trapped figures explore the delicate
  balance between protecting what you have and cooperating in power structures
  that keep you where you are — and the possibility, too, of evolving beyond
  those structures entirely.


  There are, of course, any number of paths through, and into, the work in this
  show. But however you arrive there, on the seventh floor, take some time to
  pause and reflect. Because this show is, yes, about _now_, in the broadest
  sense, but it’s also, at root, about _what might be_, and a testament to the
  Wassaic community that’s so generously helped make our own what-might-bes
  happen for the past 12 years. That we’re still around — that we were ever
  around at all — is thanks to the community members highlighted here, to their
  willingness to commit to our initial dream for this project. In any and every
  way possible, we encourage you to seek those people in your own community, and
  to entwine your life with theirs. Start now, and start where you are.


  Trust us: it’s worth doing. Now, more than ever.
