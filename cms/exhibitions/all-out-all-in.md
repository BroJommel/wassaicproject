  All out: of time, of money, of energy, of our hands. All in: our homes, our
  heads, one life, to the fire. Is there a way _through_, instead? The nine
  artists in _All Out / All In_ try to find it, exploring the increasingly
  arbitrary boundary between public and private spaces, identities, and rituals
  — with a particular emphasis on the potential of the home as a space for
  healing in the face of renewed (and overdue) attention on it as a political
  one.


  On the first floor, **Rose Nestler’s** fabric sculptures emphasize the ways in
  which women perform (or are made to perform) power (or lack thereof) through
  articles of clothing, while **Aisha Tandiwe Bell’s** traps mark the delicate
  balance between protecting what you have and cooperating in power structures
  that keep you where you are. On the second floor, **Jamea Richmond-Edwards’**
  mixed media collages reject reductive readings of Blackness and indigenous
  heritage, insisting on a nuanced, humanizing view of the ways in which these
  identities intersect with one another in the lives of real people. On the
  third floor, **Mark Fleuridor** reflects on the domestic spaces, elders, and
  rituals in his Haitian community that have carried him through to today,
  **Nyugen Smith** simultaneously reckons with the Caribbean’s colonial past and
  looks towards imaginative possibilities — magic, festivals, languages,
  geographies — for its future, while **Lee Edwards** looks at the timeless
  consumption of violence against Black bodies in America. On the fifth floor,
  **Natalie Baxter’s** eagles deflect the weird masculine energies of Americana,
  her ribbons emphasize the comical overexpectations of motherhood, and her
  quilts take a simple delight in the material possibilities of a traditional
  form. On the sixth floor, **Liz Nielsen’s** site-specific light installation
  offers a space to reflect on how the ideas in an otherwise relatively
  figurative show might take root in our inner overlapping otherworlds of
  lonelinesses, losses, longings. And on the seventh floor, **Jen Dwyer’s**
  sculptures and paintings take that moment of reflection and point towards ways
  to sustain it — offering an unabashed love letter to the daily rituals which
  restore and replenish us, celebrating the quiet, remarkable ways we make it
  through.
