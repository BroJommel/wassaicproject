I first came to Wassaic the summer after my junior year of college. Rolling into town in my 2001 Volvo stationwagon, it was like I’d entered some sort of fairy enclave. Part of it was the mountains — I’m from Illinois, so an elevation change of more than ten feet makes my breath catch. But it was also being surrounded by people who had decided to make art central to their lives, and who were doing whatever they could to elevate it.

In trying to mirror them, I did a little bit of everything that summer. AV support. Event setup. Postering. Gallery sitting. Photography. Wood hauling. Beer hauling. Eventually, I started helping out with grant and development work, from which I stumbled into writing for and building out this site. Today, I run the website and conduct, edit, and publish an ongoing series of [artist profiles](https://www.wassaicproject.org/artists/artist-profiles) with our artists-in-residence.

Wassaic is magical and I love it. I’ve tried to say a little more elsewhere on the site, but that’s, really, what it all reduces to.
