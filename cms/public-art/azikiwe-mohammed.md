  “The opening of the rail trail has invited more people into our hamlet home,
  and what better way to say hello than with another, hopefully audible, hello,
  from some of our other neighbors. Inviting rail trailers to take part in our
  commitment to the ground we live upon and the creatures that traverse it is, I
  feel, a good introduction to the Wassaic Project. A home for some, a hello for
  others, and a welcome for all, as friends un-met are just sounds not yet
  heard.” — Azikiwe Mohammed
