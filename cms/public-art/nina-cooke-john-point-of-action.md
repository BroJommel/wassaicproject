  This collection of nine sculptures arranged in groups of three invites you to
  step in, see, be seen, and take a moment of pause before moving on to take
  action. Each piece is a unique combination of bent metal and rope, encouraging
  viewers to visit each one or find their favorite. They read like
  anthropomorphic figures in the landscape, relating to each other with or
  without people within them.
